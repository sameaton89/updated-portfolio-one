        <section id="writin">
            I was conceived in Jersey City, in the bathroom of a White Castle in Journal Square. My mother put a slug in the coin-operated lock and unburdened herself as sliders dropped into sacks to become accretions of plaque in the already gridlocked blood vessels of northern New Jersey’s fast-food class. Out in the dining room addicts prostituted their time and attention to supra-septuagenarians in exchange for a stipend of prescription narcotics. A young fry cook counted down the minutes till death. Three hoodlums accosted an unlucky patron of Goodwill Industries for his secondhand 8-Ball jacket. At 3 PM I fell onto the tile, locking lips with the dried film of an industrial cleaning solution, urine dilution, and the half-footprint of a work boot. Mother walked out the bathroom as I kicked and screamed, went to the counter and bought a combo meal. Realizing she had neither slug nor coin, she was obliged to scare up a quarter from the pimpled cashier, who, under duresses not limited to the potential death of an infant and my actual screaming mother, had the fry cook, a Shawangunk alumnus thrice granted a Tombs residency, pick the cash drawer with the tine of a spork. It was not to be. The tine broke deep inside the keyhole, preventing the progress of all manner of devices, legitimate or otherwise, engineered to turn the lonely cylinder authorizing access. Turned on to the predicament and seizing the opportunity to play a pivotal, arguably heroic, role in the high drama of a postpartum SNAFU, an old man in a cabbie hat lay down his demerol and tossed my mother a coin. Day saved; with it, my life. In token of his heroic expenditure, my mother allowed him to give me first succor with a fried clam strip—my very first pacifier, but certainly not my last.
